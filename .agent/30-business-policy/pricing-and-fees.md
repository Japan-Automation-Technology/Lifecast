# Pricing and Fees

Fee policy (current fixed assumptions):
- Platform fee: 15% of successful support transactions.
- Payment processor fee: borne by creator.

Notes:
- This is a temporary strategic setting and should be revisited after early cohort data.
- Fee disclosure must be explicit in creator onboarding and supporter checkout terms.
