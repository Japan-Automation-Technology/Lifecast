# UX Principles

- Keep support flow short and explicit.
- Show funding state continuously in feed and project pages.
- Make supporter identity visible but non-intrusive.
- Prioritize trust clarity over growth tricks in payment surfaces.
- Keep creation constraints simple in MVP (no forced episodes, max 3 plans).

MVP profile structure for creators:
- Video tab: posted short-video list.
- Home tab: active project detail and key funding status.
