# Security and Compliance (MVP Baseline)

Baseline controls:
- Creator identity verification before project publication.
- Server-side validation for policy-critical fields.
- Payment callback signature verification and idempotency keys.
- Audit logs for moderation and payout/refund outcomes.
- Audit logs for dispute handling, recovery attempts, and final loss booking.

Compliance posture:
- Product is positioned as purchase-style crowdfunding, not investment/security.
- Screening includes checks against financial-instrument-like characteristics.
- MVP payment boundary is constrained to physical return/reward outcomes.
