# Question Backlog

Open decisions not fully finalized in current conversation:
- Exact payout timing details after successful campaign (batch schedule, reserve/hold rules).
- Exact legal wording and UX pattern for mobile app store compliance.
- Trust-weight criteria definition for "high-trust reports".
- Event attribute standards beyond minimum payload and versioning process owner.
- Log retention durations per class.
- Notification matrix details by role and event.
- Dispute SLA targets and support escalation windows.
- Low-conversion bitrate cap thresholds and enforcement windows.

Rule:
- Resolve questions here, then record final decisions in `decision-log.md` and update target spec file.
