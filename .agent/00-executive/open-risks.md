# Open Risks

## Product and behavior risk
- It is still a hypothesis that cheering behavior in short video converts to purchase-style support at high enough rates.
- Early feed quality may be unstable before sufficient conversion signal accumulates.

## Policy and platform risk
- Mobile app review constraints around external payment and digital flow wording can affect UX design.
- Refund economics may create creator dissatisfaction if fee/processor losses are perceived as opaque.

## Trust risk
- "User judgment first" moderation posture is not sufficient alone.
- Without fast moderation actions and audit logs, disputes and fraud risk can escalate quickly.

## Operational risk
- Dispute handling workload can grow quickly after launch.
- Delayed project updates can erode supporter trust unless enforced by policy and reminders.

## Data risk
- If funnel events are inconsistently defined across clients/backend, optimization becomes unreliable.

Mitigation direction:
- Keep hard event contracts.
- Keep explicit publication checks.
- Keep stop/appeal SLA and evidence logs.
