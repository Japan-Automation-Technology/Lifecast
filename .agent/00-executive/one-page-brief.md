# One Page Brief

Product name: Lifecast

Tagline:
- Short-video-first crowdfunding for creators building products in public.

Core idea:
- Founders post short videos (up to 3 minutes in MVP) that document project progress from start to completion.
- Viewers discover projects via vertical feed, then support via purchase-style crowdfunding plans.
- Support behavior is designed around "cheering + participation", not passive viewing.

Primary wedge (initial battlefield):
- Process-economy-friendly categories where making progress is entertainment.
- Focus: toC creative projects, especially game and hardware development.
- Typical consumer price band target: low to mid (thousands of yen equivalent), iterative improvement based on supporter feedback.

Differentiation vs short video platforms:
- Native funding conversion in app flow.
- Feed composition is challenge/project-heavy by default.
- Supporter identity is visible (badge, supporter list, supported-project profile section).

Differentiation vs legacy crowdfunding:
- Video-first discovery and storytelling.
- Scroll-based exploration of many projects quickly.
- Faster two-way interaction through mobile-native comments and creator updates.

Business hypothesis:
- Existing workflow is fragmented (TikTok attention -> external crowdfunding conversion).
- Lifecast unifies discovery, engagement, and funding conversion.
- Creators can still repurpose content to TikTok/Instagram for top-of-funnel acquisition.

North-star direction:
- Increase active time and repeat support behavior while maintaining trust.
