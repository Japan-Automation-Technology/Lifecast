# UI Post-Implementation Test Skill

Use this skill after any UI-affecting implementation.

## Required loop (must do all)
1. Write how to reach the target screen before testing.
- Either document manual navigation steps explicitly, or
- Instruct/create a dedicated script for that specific screen every time.

2. Capture screenshot evidence of the target UI.
- Save absolute screenshot path(s).

3. Review screenshots and identify visual issues.
- If issues are found, return to implementation and fix.
- Re-run navigation + screenshot capture.
- Repeat until no critical visual issue remains.

## Reporting format
- Screen reach method used (manual steps or newly created script)
- Screenshot absolute paths
- Detected issues and fixes applied
- Final residual issues (if any)

## If blocked
- Do not mark task complete.
- Report exact command/step and error.
- Report what was validated and what remains unverified.
