# Lifecast Agent Knowledge Base

Purpose: This folder is the single source of truth for AI-driven product and engineering work on Lifecast.

Read order:
1. `00-executive/one-page-brief.md`
2. `00-executive/frozen-decisions.md`
3. `40-mvp-spec/scope-in-out.md`
4. `50-data-analytics/funnel-definition.md`
5. `30-business-policy/trust-and-safety-policy.md`
6. `70-delivery/implementation-workbreakdown.md`
7. `60-architecture/api-contract-rules.md`
8. `50-data-analytics/event-contract-v1.md`
9. `60-architecture/openapi-draft.yaml`
10. `60-architecture/db-schema-draft.sql`
11. `70-delivery/mcp-skills-and-secrets-setup.md`
12. `70-delivery/ui-automation-standard.md`
13. Relevant deeper folders based on task

How to use this hierarchy:
- Read this file first.
- Read each target folder `README.md` before opening files inside it.
- Go deeper only when needed to avoid context bloat.
- Treat `00-executive/frozen-decisions.md` as the current hard constraints.
- Record any new decision in `70-delivery/decision-log.md` and cross-link the updated spec file.

Folder map:
- `00-executive/`: Compressed briefing, fixed decisions, top risks.
- `10-vision-strategy/`: Vision, positioning, growth loop.
- `20-product/`: User segments, journeys, UX principles.
- `30-business-policy/`: Fees, payment/refund, trust and safety, obligations.
- `40-mvp-spec/`: MVP in/out scope, core flows, requirements.
- `50-data-analytics/`: Event taxonomy, funnel, KPI definitions, retention.
- `60-architecture/`: System context, domain model, API boundaries, security baseline.
- `70-delivery/`: Roadmap, milestones, implementation breakdown, decision log, question backlog.
- `templates/`: Reusable templates for PRD and ADR.
