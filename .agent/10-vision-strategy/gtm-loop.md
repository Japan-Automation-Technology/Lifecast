# GTM Loop

Initial acquisition strategy:
- Creators repurpose Lifecast-ready vertical videos to TikTok/Instagram.
- External posts drive audience into Lifecast project pages/feed.

Engagement strategy:
- Keep high density of active projects in feed.
- Use supporter-visible identity artifacts (badge, supported list) to reinforce participation.

Monetization strategy:
- Optimize for payment-success conversion and repeat support, not vanity engagement.

Early expansion logic:
- Start narrow (game/hardware process projects), then expand adjacent categories with similar process-entertainment value.
