# Differentiation

## Against short-video apps
- Native crowdfunding conversion path in the same experience.
- Project progress and funding state are first-class UI objects.
- Supporter identity and contribution status are visible in social surfaces.

## Against legacy crowdfunding
- Feed-native discovery instead of listing-first browsing.
- High-frequency progress storytelling through short clips.
- Tighter creator-supporter interaction loops in mobile comments and updates.

## Defensible behavior loop
- Progress content attracts attention.
- Attention converts to support.
- Supporters influence roadmap.
- Creator posts outcomes of supporter influence.
- This creates higher trust and repeat support behavior.
