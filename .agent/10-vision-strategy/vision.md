# Vision

Long-term ambition:
- Make creator-led product development and early-stage funding native to short-video behavior.

Future-state thesis:
- Building in public + micro-community feedback + direct support can become a standard startup path for consumer-facing creative products.

What success looks like:
- Creators repeatedly launch and improve products through supporter feedback loops on LifeCast.
- Supporters become identity-level participants, not one-time buyers.
- LifeCast becomes the default bridge between attention and funding for process-heavy creators.

Non-goal at this stage:
- Becoming a general-purpose ecommerce backend for post-campaign operations.
